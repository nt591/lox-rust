# Introduction

This repository follows the book Crafting Interpreters (craftinginterpreters.com) from Bob Nystrom.

It is a Rust implementation of the Clox bytecode virtual machine. I'm doing this during a Recurse Center (recurse.com) half batch.

I plan on getting it done throughout 6 weeks in order to learn Rust, apply what I'm learning from Engineering a Compiler (Cooper and Torczon), and other resources.
